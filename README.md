# **Classic Models SQL Case Study**

## **Overview**
This repository showcases a collection of SQL queries and use cases derived from the Classic Models database. These queries were originally created as part of an SQL assignment but have been refactored to address real-world business scenarios. The focus is on providing actionable insights and demonstrating advanced SQL skills in querying, reporting, database design, and optimization.

## **Introduction**
The Classic Models database is a fictional business dataset often used for learning SQL. This case study analyzes sales, employee performance, shipping patterns, and more, simulating challenges faced by businesses. By tackling these tasks, I aimed to demonstrate proficiency in SQL concepts like joins, views, stored procedures, triggers, and window functions.

## **Business Use Cases**
The queries address the following real-world scenarios:
- **Top Shipping Countries**: Identify regions with the highest shipping demand.
- **Employee-Manager Relationships**: Analyze reporting structures within teams.
- **Product Category Sales**: Track revenue and order frequency across product categories.
- **Customer Ranking**: Rank customers based on their order frequency to prioritize engagement.
- **Year-over-Year Growth Analysis**: Calculate and visualize order trends over time.
- **Error Handling and Triggers**: Ensure data integrity through exception handling and triggers.

## **Skills Demonstrated**
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient use of indexes, filtering, and grouping.
- **Joins**: Inner joins, self-joins, and multi-table joins.
- **Views and Stored Procedures**: Encapsulating logic for reuse and modularity.
- **Window Functions**: Advanced analytics using rank, dense_rank, lag, and lead.
- **Error Handling**: Managing exceptions and maintaining data integrity.
- **Triggers**: Automating validations and transformations.
